# BluePrintLists

## Overview

This project is meant as a demonstration of good practices in building and testing a list app, but one where you can create blueprints of frequently used lists so you can recreate them whenerver needed.

I'll be adding functionality in small steps here, but you can see the final result in [Reusable Lists](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/reusable-lists/id6478542301?platform=iphone)
